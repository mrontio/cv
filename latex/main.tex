    \section*{Personal Statement}
    \summary{A PhD student interested in novel forms of computing, lead by curiosity and people.}

    \section*{Education}
    \education{PhD in Artificial Intelligence, Compter Science and Electronics}{2023}{2027}{University of Southampton}{
      \noindent Integrated PhD as part of MINDS CDT.\\
      Dissertation: ``Neuromorphic Computing: Representations, compilation and digital architectures.'' \\
      Supervisors: Prof. David Thomas, Dr. Ruomeng Huang. \\
      The PhD explores the novel paradigm of neuromorphic computing and contributes to formalisation of a neuromorphic algorithms, whilst designing a neuromorphic accelerator and neural network to FPGA compiler to be evaluated in real-life scenarios.
    }
    \education{MSci in Computer Science with a Year in Industry}{2018}{2023}{Swansea University}{
      \noindent Integrated Master's with First Class Honours. \\
      MSci Dissertation: HoP: Higher-order framework for the PYNQ FPGA Ecosystem, supervised by Dr. CÃ©cilia Pradic.\\
      BSc Dissertation: Implementing Single-Event Upset Fault Tolerance onto a RISC-V Core, supervised by Dr. Shane Fleming.\\
      Gained experience with full-stack software engineering, digital design on FPGAs, and collaborations through courseworks and assessments.}


    \section*{Work Experience}
    \work{HPC Engineer Intern}{2020}{2021}{Intel Corporation}{
    Worked with customers to optimise applications on Intel HPC platform. Got to work with pre-production versions of Ice Lake Xeon CPUs, and Intel's first dedicated graphics product DG1. Wrote low-level applications for improved memory management, including cache-level optimisations. Maintained research lab and lead installations of tens of high-end nodes. Collaborated with senior employees to deliver complex systems for financial customers.}
    \work{Computer Science Teaching Assistant}{2019}{2023}{Swansea University}{
      Helped lecturers create ideal learning environment by checking student's lab work for correctness, and aided students in understanding of concepts and procedures.}
    \newpage
    \work{I.T. Manager}{2017}{2018}{Melody Real Estate Management}{
    Part-time job during Secondary School. Sole I.T. employee for a team of 6 people; required understanding and acting on employee's concerns, fixing day-to-day I.T. issues, and maintaining systems.
    }



    \section*{Volunteering}
    \volunteering{Ambassador Volunteer}{2018 --- 2020}{Technocamps}{
    Contributed time to organisation providing after-school science activities to children aged 10 to 16. Required understanding of children's intuition and develop explanations which worked for each individual, and managed the environment for a fun and engaging learning class.}
    \volunteering{Swansea University Ecological Volunteering}{2021 --- 2022}{Swansea University}{
    Cleaned up beaches and uprooted trees in Swansea's ecologically sensitive habitats to promote local flora and fauna.}
    \volunteering{General Volunteering}{2018 --- 2019}{Discovery Volunteering}{Numerous volunteering opportunities, including running events for people in need of help, preparing hygiene kits for homeless and park cleanings.}

    \section*{Skills}
    \skill{Languages}{C, C++, Python, Java, Verilog, Haskell, Scala, SpinalHDL.}
    \skill{Hardware}{PYNQ Z2, Raspberry Pi \{4b, 5\}, Arduino, Dell EMC, servers, RISC-V, x86.}
    \skill{Software}{Vitis, Vitis HLS, Vivado, Linux, NixOS, Emacs, \LaTeX.}
    \skill{Soft Skills}{Team work, leadership, teaching, working with children, self-management, problem solving, time management.}
    \skill{Physical Skills}{Computer Maintenance, Electronics Soldering, Bicycle Repair.}

    \section*{Interests}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Systems --- I enjoy building homelab systems on the cheap.
    \item Cycling --- Cycling has been my choice of sport since I was a teenager, my current interest is in gravel biking and bike packing.
    \item Hiking --- Camping and hiking is what I always aim to do more of.
    \item Software  --- Mostly tinkering with Emacs or NixOS, contributing to open source.
    \item Reading --- Currently : The Joy of Abstraction: An Exploration of Math, Category Theory and Life by Eugenia Cheng.
